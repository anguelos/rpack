# rpack
rpack is a little library
for packing rectangles of different sizes
into a bigger rectangle as efficiently as possible

it works with python 2.7.6.
python 3.x is not supported atm.

rpack has no dependencies right now
if you want to run the example,
( it's included in the file )
you need to install pyglet
