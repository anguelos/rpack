# rpack
rpack is a little library
for packing rectangles of different sizes
into a bigger rectangle as efficiently as possible

it works with python 2.7.6,
and probably with 3.x as well,
but it is not tested with 3.x yet,
because i did the early tests with pyglet.

rpack has no dependencies right now
if you want to run the example,
you need to install pyglet
